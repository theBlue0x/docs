Token Operations
-------------------

### Decode File Token

Validate a file token without requiring the transmission of a secret passphrase. POST only.

**Request:**

*   _requestType_ is _decodeFileToken_
*   _file_ is the path to the file that was signed
*   _token_ is the token of the _file_, as generated by [Generate File Token](#generate-file-token "The Blue0x API")

**Response:**

*   _account_ (S) is the account number that generated the token
*   _accountRS_ (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
*   _timestamp_ (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
*   _valid_ (B) is _true_ if token is valid, _false_ otherwise
*   _requestProcessingTime_ (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since _token_ contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, _file_ can be validated as signed by the owner of the public key, and the public key determines the account ID.

**Example:** Refer to [Decode File Token](API_Examples.md#decode-file-token "The Blue0x API Examples") example.

### Decode Token

Validate a token without requiring the transmission of a secret passphrase.

**Request:**

*   _requestType_ is _decodeToken_
*   _website_ is the signed text, typically an authorized URL
*   _token_ is the token generated by [Generate Token](#generate-token "The Blue0x API")

**Response:**

*   _account_ (S) is the account number that generated the token
*   _accountRS_ (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
*   _timestamp_ (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was created
*   _valid_ (B) is _true_ if token is valid, _false_ otherwise
*   _requestProcessingTime_ (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since _token_ contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, _website_ can be validated as authorized by the owner of the public key, and the public key determines the account ID.

**Example:** Refer to [Decode Token](API_Examples.md#decode-token "The Blue0x API Examples") example.

### Generate File Token

Generate a file token. POST only.

**Request:**

*   _requestType_ is _generateFileToken_
*   _secretPhrase_ is the passphrase of the account generating the token
*   _file_ is the path to the file to be signed

**Response:**

*   _token_ (S) is a 160 character string representing the 100-byte token which consists of a 32-byte public key, a 4-byte timestamp, and a 64-byte digital signature
*   _account_ (S) is the account number corresponding to _secretPhrase_
*   _accountRS_ (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
*   _timestamp_ (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
*   _valid_ (B) is true if token is valid, false otherwise
*   _requestProcessingTime_ (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since _token_ contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, the _file_ can be validated as digitally signed by the owner of the public key using [Decode File Token](#decode-file-token "The Blue0x API").

**Example:** Refer to [Generate File Token](API_Examples.md#generate-file-token "The Blue0x API Examples") example.

### Generate Token

Generate a token. POST only.

**Request:**

*   _requestType_ is _generateToken_
*   _secretPhrase_ is the passphrase of the account generating the token
*   _website_ is a web site URL for which authorization should be granted, or general text to be digitally signed

**Note:** _website_ is typically a URL (with the leading https:// unnecessary) that an account owner signs with his _secretPhrase_ (private key) to bind the account to the URL, but _website_ can be any text that the owner wishes to sign.

**Response:**

*   _token_ (S) is a 160 character string representing the 100-byte token which consists of a 32-byte public key, a 4-byte timestamp, and a 64-byte signature
*   _account_ (S) is the account number corresponding to _secretPhrase_
*   _accountRS_ (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
*   _timestamp_ (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
*   _valid_ (B) is _true_ if token is valid, _false_ otherwise
*   _requestProcessingTime_ (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since _token_ contains the token generator's public key and signature, the _website_ can be validated as authorized by the owner of the public key using [Decode Token](#decode-token "The Blue0x API").

**Example:** Refer to [Generate Token](API_Examples.md#generate-token "The Blue0x API Examples") example.
