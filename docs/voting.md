â‹®

**Note:** The allowed vote values are integers between _minRangeValue_ and _maxRangeValue_, inclusive. This range, along with the minimum and maximum number of options that can and must be voted on are specified when the poll is created. Refer to [Create Poll](#create-poll "The Blue0x API").

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](index.md#create-transaction-response "The Blue0x API").

**Example:** Refer to [Cast Vote](API_Examples.md#cast-vote "The Blue0x API Examples") example.
