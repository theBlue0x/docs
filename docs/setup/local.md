## Setup your Blue0x Windows Desktop Wallet

You will need the latest Java JDK installed on your computer and you will need to set your JAVA_HOME PATH.

## Procedure To Install the JDK Software and Set JAVA_HOME on a Windows System

1. To install the JDK software, do the following:
    
    a.  Go to  [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp).
        
    b.  Select the appropriate JDK software and click Download.
        
      The JDK software is installed on your computer in the default location; for example, at  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02. You can move the JDK software to another location.
        
2.  To set  JAVA_HOME, do the following:
    
    a.  Right click My Computer and select Properties.
        
    b.  On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables, and then edit  JAVA_HOME  to point to where the JDK software is located, for example,  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02.
