## **The Blue0x Marketplace** ##

_Published December 7th, 2021_

Blue0x Market is where Blue0x users may buy and sell physical or digital goods and services in exchange for their native [Blue0x Currency](currencies.md).  It is available at [market.blue0x.com](https://market.blue0x.com) or, additionally, you may host the software on your local machine.  

**Shipping:**

Being that Blue0x is a new endeavor, there currently is no method of payment with a Blue0x Currency for shipping costs.  For this reason, it is encouraged for new users to buy/sell goods and services locally, within their community.  You are free to work out shipping with a buyer/seller.  However, you will be responsible for payment of shipping costs in your respective fiat currency.  Payment for shipping with a Blue0x Currency is a goal that can be realized as the Blue0x Network evolves and the demand for the service increases.
