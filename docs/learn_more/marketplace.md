## **The Blue0x Market** ##

_Published August 19th, 2021_

The Blue0x Market is where Blue0x users may buy and sell physical or digital goods and services in exchange for their native [Blue0x Currency](currencies.md).  The Blue0x Market is available at [https://market.blue0x.com](https://market.blue0x.com) or additionally, you may host Blue0x Market on your local machine.  At this time, the Blue0x Market only specifies payments in USDX - United States Dollar.  As the Blue0x Network progresses, each Blue0x Currency will host its own respective market.  

**Shipping:**

Being that Blue0x is a new endeavor, there currently is no method of payment with a Blue0x Currency for shipping costs.  For this reason, it is encouraged for new Blue0x Market users to buy/sell goods and services locally within their community.  Shipping options ARE currently available when posting an item for sale.  However, you are responsible for payment of shipping costs in your respective fiat currency.  Payment for shipping with a Blue0x Currency is a goal that can be achieved as the Blue0x Network evolves.
