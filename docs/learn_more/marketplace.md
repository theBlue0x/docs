## **The Blue0x Marketplace** ##

_Published August 19th, 2021_

The Blue0x Marketplace is where Blue0x users can buy and sell physical or digital goods and services.  The Blue0x Marketplace is available at [https://market.blue0x.com](https://market.blue0x.com) or additionally, you may host the Blue0x Marketplace on your local machine.  At this time, the Blue0x Marketplace will only specify payments in USDX - United States Dollar.  As the Blue0x Network progresses, each Blue0x Currency will host its own respective marketplace.  

**Shipping:**

Being that Blue0x is a new endeavor, there currently is no method of payment in a Blue0x Currency for shipping costs.  For this reason, it is encouraged for new Blue0x Marketplace users to buy/sell goods and services locally within their community.  Shipping options ARE currently available when posting an item for sale.  However, you will be responsible for payment of shipping costs in your respective fiat currency.  Payment for shipping with a Blue0x Currency is a goal that can be achieved as the Blue0x Network evolves.
