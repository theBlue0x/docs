## **Blue0x is Crypto. Reimagined.** ##

The Blue0x Network bridges the gap between tangible goods and services and a sustainable, decentralized, global financial system. The Blue0x Network uses a pure [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus protocol which has proven to be secure, reliable, and energy-efficient. 


**Within the Blue0x Network :**

* Blue0x [CURRENCIES](currencies.md) | currencies modeled after real-world fiat currencies (i.e. USD -> USDX)

* Blue0x [MARKETPLACE](marketplace.md) | buy and sell physical goods and services in your native Blue0x currency

* Blue0x [EXCHANGE](exchange.md) | exchange your native Blue0x currency with other Blue0x currencies around the world (i.e. USDX <-> EURX)

This facilitates a REAL USE CASE for cryptocurrency, not simply speculation of price in relation to fiat currency.  Blue0x does not plan on having any fiat currency on/off ramps and is not intended to be traded on crypto exchanges.ₐ   Blue0x strives to have a self-contained ecosystem, fully independent of fiat or other cryptocurrencies, that can then evolve into a well-trusted platform to ultimately replace the current financial system.


*ₐWith the nature of a decentralized network, the Blue0x Dev team cannot maintain any amount of control over BLX or Blue0x currencies.  However, we hope to foster a mindset and a culture within the user community that will enable this vision to become a reality*
