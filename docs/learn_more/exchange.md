## **The Blue0x Currency Exchange** ##

All Blue0x Currencies are exchangeable for BLX, and vice-versa, via the Blue0x Exchange.  Holders of a Blue0x Currency may publish an exchange offer specifying the buy and sell rate of the currency much the same as banks or currency exchanges publish their exchange rates.  All Blue0x Network users will be required to occasionally transact with the Blue0x Exchange in order to obtain BLX to pay network transaction fees.  It is available at [exchange.blue0x.com](https://exchange.blue0x.com) or, additionally, you may host the software on your local machine.

**Exchange Rate:**

The exchange rate of each Blue0x Currency is in relation to BLX.  This rate ultimately determines the 'cost' of each transaction on the Blue0x Network. 

**Forex Trading:**

As the Blue0x Network matures, arbitration opportunities between Blue0x Currencies will become available.  This will ultimately create a FOREX-type trading environment within the Blue0x Network.
