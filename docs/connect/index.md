Blue0x operates fully in a totally decentralized and distributed manner.  For this reason, you are required to run a 
full node in order to utilize your wallet, the Marketplace, or the Exchange.  This ensures that the network has no central point-of-failure,  
remains resistant to censorship, and that it is always available.
