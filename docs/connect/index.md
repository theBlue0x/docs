## **Connect to the Blue0x Network** ##

Blue0x operates in a fully decentralized and distributed manner.  For this reason, you are required to run a full node in order to utilize your Wallet, the Marketplace, and/or the Exchange.  This ensures that the network has no central point-of-failure, remains resistant to censorship, and that it is always available.
